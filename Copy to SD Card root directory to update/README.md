# BigTreeTech TFT Adjustments

Please copy the following files to your SD-card. All are prepared here.

- BIGTREE_TFT35_V3.0_E3.27.x.bin
- config.ini
- language_en.ini
- TFT35

I did copy language_en.ini from Language Packs. It has to be copied in the root directory, not in language pack-folder.
I did copy TFT35 from THEME_The Round Miracle Menu Material theme, see above.
